# Cuisine-web
The Cuisine Web project is a responsive, front-end website that showcases diverse cuisines from around the world, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage features a bold hero section and a grid of cuisine cards (e.g., Italian, Indian, Japanese, Mexican, Mediterranean), each with an image, short intro, and quick actions. Users can search.
